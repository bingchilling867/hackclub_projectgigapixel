**Description**

Project Gigapixel will be an advanced, large-format scanning back camera inspired automated photography system that will use a microcontroller-powered automated indexing mechanism to capture dozens of photos in a RxC grid configuration that can be stitched together to form one super-high-resolution 1000+ megapixel photo using relatively outdated consumer camera tech - the camera system used as the foundation will be a Lumix GF3 from 2011 - old, but still lightweight and capable.

To use Project Gigapixel:

*3d print all the CAD files needed using PLA, PETG, or ABS at 75%+ infill (Do not use any flexible or lightweight filament as it will bend or fail)
Attach everything according to the CAD (use glue, screws will wear down the print)
*Wire it up with the chosen microcontroller (no wiring guide since everyone's pin layout will be different) and paste my code if you are using arduino.
*Lock in your camera and lens using using the M3 screw mounts on the side
*Turn on the camera and enter in the parameters of your intended panorama/wide-angle shot using the buttons - also make a new file folder if possible. Your final megapixel count will be shown on the OLED.
*After 10 seconds of no user input, the system will automatically start indexing and taking images.
 Save the photos taken to a PC, open Adobe Lightroom, and use the photo merge feature to select and combine them into one massive, super high res picture
*Enjoy!

**Why I designed Project Gigapixel**

This project was influenced by both my personal desire for a super high res camera, and also the lengths I have seen my friends and colleagues go to in order to 
obtain such a camera, often spending hundreds or thousands. I also wanted to democratize high-res cameras; similar examples like the Hasselblad X2d 100C (100MP) are
almost $10,000 - without the lens included. I have also personally loved giving old, cast-away tech new life; Project Gigapixel does just that.
