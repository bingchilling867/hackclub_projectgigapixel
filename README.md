**Description**

Project Gigapixel will be an advanced, large-format scanning back camera inspired automated photography system that will use a microcontroller-powered automated indexing mechanism to capture dozens of photos in a RxC grid configuration that can be stitched together to form one super-high-resolution 1000+ megapixel photo using relatively outdated consumer camera tech - the camera system used as the foundation will be a Lumix GF3 from 2011 - old, but still lightweight and capable.

To use Project Gigapixel (I'm gonna shorten it to PGP): 

1: 3d print all the CAD files needed 
2: Attach everything according to the CAD (use glue, screws will wear down the print)
3) Wire it up with the chosen microcontroller (no wiring guide since everyone's pin layout will be different) and paste my code if you are using arduino
4) Lock in your camera and lens
5) Fire it up! the button layout is really simple, no instructions necessary and the OLED has only three parameters displayed.

**BOM** 
I already made a price breakdown on google sheets and I don't want to remake the table on github so here's a public link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AInIPOB9SZRDkSFSyj3q_OnJjby_8-9bT9j9aeVaWH4/edit?usp=sharing


**CAD** 100% of the design work was done in Onshape. I imported one thing, which was a 9g servo model and its corresponding servo arm, everything else is natively designed by me.

*btw the CAD pictures are different from my project banner as I forgot to add in the auto shutter servo, it was hidden from the assembly by accident
